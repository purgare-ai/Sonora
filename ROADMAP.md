# Sonora Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Seeding the Foundation
- Launch GitHub repo with open license and documentation
- Publish emotional tagging schema
- Begin collecting and tagging a seed set of songs using Spotify’s API

## Phase 2: Build the Tagging Tool
- Simple web interface for contributors to tag music by mood and musical features
- Save tags to an open dataset

## Phase 3: Prototype Playlist Engine
- Generate playlists based on emotional filters (e.g., “nostalgic + acoustic + <90 BPM”)
- Use Spotify audio features and community tags

## Phase 4: Community Expansion
- Outreach to musicians, listeners, universities, and ethical AI communities
- Encourage research projects or public contributions

## Phase 5: Long-Term Features
- Open dataset publication
- Artist dashboards
- Embeddable player
- Optional integrations with Apple/Spotify libraries (as overlays, not competitors)

This roadmap will evolve based on contributor input.
