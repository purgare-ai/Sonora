# 🎧 Sonora: Emotionally Intelligent Music Discovery

> *"There’s a song for how you feel. The problem is, it’s buried under 100 million others."*

**Sonora** is a community-driven experiment in emotional music discovery—built for listeners who feel overlooked, for artists who remain undiscovered, and for everyone tired of being fed the same safe algorithmic loops.

What if we could find music the way we feel it—not by genre or release date, but by *mood*, *texture*, and *what’s happening inside us*?

Sonora is our answer. It’s not a product. It’s not a startup. It’s an open-source project fueled by shared curiosity and sound.

## 🧠 What Sonora Does

- Creates **living playlists** based on emotional resonance, musical structure, and user-submitted tags.
- Uses a blend of **machine learning**, **audio analysis**, and **community input** to organize music by how it *feels*, not how it sells.
- Surfaces **buried gems**—old, new, obscure, global—based on your emotional context.
- Helps **independent artists** reach the people who are most likely to love their sound.

---

## 💡 What Makes It Different

- 🔖 **Crowd-tagged taxonomy** of emotional states, moods, and musical traits.
- 🧬 Inspired by the **Music Genome Project**, built with modern machine learning.
- 🎶 Designed to **evolve with you**—your listening shapes what Sonora becomes.
- 🕊️ **Not for sale. Not ad-supported. Not for data mining.** Ever.

## 🌱 How You Can Contribute

- 🧠 **Data scientists & devs** to help with playlist generation, clustering, and ML pipelines.
- 🎨 **Designers & writers** to help communicate the project with clarity and beauty.
- 🎼 **Artists & musicians** who want to help shape a new discovery model.
