# Sonora: Emotionally Intelligent Music Discovery

**Sonora** is an open-source, crowd-tagged music discovery platform that reimagines how we find musicâ€”not by genre or popularity, but by emotional resonance, musical traits, and listener experience.

Sonora blends community-driven tagging, machine learning, and audio feature analysis to build *living playlists* that evolve based on listener input and emotional states.

## Why Sonora?

- Current platforms recommend music based on popularity or opaque algorithms.
- Listeners struggle to find music that reflects their emotions or experiences.
- Independent artists are rarely discovered unless they go viral.

## What Makes Sonora Different

- **Emotional and Musical Tagging**: Songs are categorized by mood, instrumentation, lyrical tone, and more.
- **Crowd Wisdom**: Anyone can contribute tags and refine emotional associations.
- **Living Playlists**: Lists grow and shift based on collective listening behavior and contextual feedback.
- **Open by Design**: Fully open-source and protected against corporate appropriation.

## Core Goals

- Support emotional self-expression and discovery through music.
- Elevate unknown or independent artists.
- Provide a privacy-conscious, ethical alternative to commercial recommendation engines.
