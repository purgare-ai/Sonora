# Contributing to Sonora

Welcome! Sonora is a community-driven project focused on ethical, emotionally-aware music discovery. You don’t need to be a developer to contribute—we value perspectives from musicians, listeners, data enthusiasts, and designers too.

## How You Can Help

- **Tag Songs**: Contribute emotional, musical, or thematic tags to songs.
- **Design & UX**: Help shape how users explore playlists and emotions.
- **Build Tools**: Code features for playlist generation, tagging interfaces, or audio analysis.
- **Curate Datasets**: Share or refine open music datasets.

## Guidelines

- Be respectful and open-minded. Sonora is a space for collaboration, not competition.
- Contributions must align with the project’s mission of *open, non-commercial, user-centered discovery*.
- If you fork the project, retain attribution and remain open-source under AGPLv3.
